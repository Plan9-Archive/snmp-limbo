# status

tools & library are usable, not heavily tested.
trap listener, server, snmp v3, and smi/mib parser are absent and might come later.


# about

this package contains an snmp client library and tools using these
libraries.  only for versions 1 and 2, not version 3 (perhaps later).
it does not yet have a trap listener.  it does not now include an
snmp server, but might in the future.  likewise, it does not parse
mib/smi files, but a tool to convert mib's to files for a name-oid
mapping would be nice.

see the manual pages snmpget(1) and snmpclient(2) for details.


# download

get the latest version from:

	http://www.ueber.net/code/r/snmp


# install

to install, first make a file "mkconfig" similar to your inferno's
installation mkconfig (symlink/bind it).  create "/dis/snmp", to
hold the tools.  now type "mk install" to compile and install.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.

apply the patch doc/appl-lib-asn1.b.diff to inferno's appl/lib/asn1.b.

# todo

- should we have more strict max-repetitions in bulk request?  and/or
  handle toobig errors by retransmitting with fewer values?  the first
  is probably not necessary, the second can be fixed by the caller.
- make proper modifications for asn1.b

- implement listener for traps
- implement server
- implement snmpv3
- implement tool to convert mib's to files for name <->oid mapping
